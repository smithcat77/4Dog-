Robot Guidebot for visually impaired college students.
This robot utilizes a dynamic gridspace from 3 ESP32 UWB sensors.
Inside the gridspace we implemented path planning, obstacle detection, and re-routing
Users can verbally tell the robot where they would like to go and the robot guides them to that location
Future implementaion will include an app with GPS positional monoitoring, and 2 LiDAR sensors, 3D Intel Camera
